# Agentic Financial Operations Assistant 🛡️🤖

An enterprise-grade, autonomous multi-agent platform for financial operations across Customer Support, Payments, Fraud, and Internal Operations. Built with **Spring Boot (Java 17/21)**, **MySQL**, and **React (Vite)** with built-in **RBI / DPDP compliance**, **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approvals**, and a **plain-language audit ledger**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement & Mission
Financial institutions use disconnected tools (Zendesk CRM, Stripe/Razorpay Payment Gateways, Fraud databases, internal Slack/Jira approvals). Operations agents spend hours context-switching, reading transcripts, and manually executing refunds or holds.

**Our Solution:** An AI Agent platform that autonomously processes routine financial ops requests in seconds while keeping humans in the approval loop for high-risk or irreversible actions.

## 🛡️ Guardrails & Enterprise Rules

1. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Any refund exceeding **INR 5,000** or any account freeze triggered by elevated fraud scores (Risk >= 50) is paused and pushed to the Manager Approval Inbox with a 1-click evidence package.
2. **RBI & DPDP Privacy Compliance:** All raw customer inputs are sanitized before agent processing:
   - Aadhaar: `2345 6789 0123` ➔ `[AADHAAR: XXXX-XXXX-0123]`
   - PAN: `ABCDE1234F` ➔ `[PAN: ABCDE****F]`
   - Cards: `4111222233334444` ➔ `[CARD: 4111-XXXX-XXXX-4444]`
   - Phone: `+91 9876543210` ➔ `[PHONE: +91-XXXXXX3210]`
   - UPI: `user@okaxis` ➔ `[UPI: us****@okaxis]`
3. **Auditability:** Every decision records a plain-language explanation and a cost metric ($0.0024 avg per transaction).
